        <p>These 3-ingredient peanut butter cookies are one of my favorite cookies to make. They are the only peanut butter cookies my family will eat! Sprinkle a pinch of sugar on cookies before baking, if desired.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup peanut butter</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix peanut butter, sugar, and egg together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Roll mixture into small balls and arrange on a baking sheet; flatten each with a fork, making a criss-cross pattern.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before moving to a plate.</li>
        </ol>
